        I am an **Integration Specialist** with 3+ years of experience in 
        **IBM App Connect Enterprise (ACE)** and **IBM MQ**. I specialize in 
        architecting secure middleware solutions within the **Healthcare domain**, 
        specifically for claims processing and enrollment systems. By leveraging 
        **ESQL** and modern **REST API** patterns, I build high-performance 
        data flows that automate complex business integrations and reduce 
        system latency.
